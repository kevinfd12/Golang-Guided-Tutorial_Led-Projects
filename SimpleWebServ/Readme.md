What is this?

A web server is a software program that runs on a computer and listens for incoming requests from client devices, 
such as web browsers, and responds by sending back the requested data, usually in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, or other files.

Why? 

A simple web server is a lightweight server that can serve static files or dynamic content with basic features, such as handling HTTP requests, 
serving files from a directory, and generating dynamic content using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby.
